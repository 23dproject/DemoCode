Future

- C# 8 (maybe)
  - Record types
  - "With" for record types
  - "With" for other types?
  - Check out more details with Bill Wagner later

- Static analysis
  - Part of the language
  - Something separate?

- More in the framework?
  - System.Collections.Immutable is in .NET Core, but not .NET Standard (yet)
  - Line between "released" and "mainstream" blurs as official NuGet packages
    are common

- More memory model details?
  - Could make it sane
  - Could give guidance about best practices
